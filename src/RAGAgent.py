# Purpose: This file defines the RAGAgent class, which acts as the primary Large Language Model (LLM) agent in this project. 
# The RAGAgent class is responsible for understanding the user's request and choosing the appropriate functionality to 
# to gather external knowledge, enhancing the quality of its answers. It retrieves additional context from vector databases and/or LangChain tools.
# Through Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG), it allows the agent to better understand the user's queries without fully relying on its
# pretrained internal knowledge.
